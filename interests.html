    <h1>My Interests and Goals</h1>
    <p>
      Outside of classes and technical projects, two things I’m passionate about are <strong>investing</strong> and
      <strong>fitness</strong>. I spend a lot of my free time researching the stock market, following financial news,
      and testing different strategies for long-term growth. Over the past year, I’ve been studying how different
      sectors respond to broader economic trends and how to manage risk through diversification. It’s been both
      challenging and rewarding — I’ve learned a lot about balancing short-term fluctuations with long-term conviction,
      and I’ve managed to grow my portfolio by roughly <strong>30% year-over-year</strong> so far. My next goal is to
      build a more structured investment plan, focus on learning fundamental analysis in depth, and track performance
      more consistently through data visualization tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not looking at charts or reading market reports, I love going to the <strong>gym</strong>. Working out is
      my way to reset — it keeps me focused, disciplined, and motivated. I usually train five days a week, mixing weight
      training with cardio. Fitness has taught me the same principles that apply to investing: patience, consistency,
      and commitment. Whether I’m lifting weights or analyzing stock trends, I enjoy the process of setting measurable
      goals and tracking progress over time. Both areas challenge me to improve a little bit every day, and I find that
      incredibly fulfilling.
